Visualizing NBA player trade relationships.

Inspired by: https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/1/30/18202947/nba-transaction-trees

Data comes from the wonderful Pro Sports Transactions website: http://www.prosportstransactions.com/

- build_trade_network.R scrapes and cleans data from Pro Sports Transactions website
- app.R contains all frontend code for application
